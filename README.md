# Project: ToDo List
This is a very simple project to showcase an understanding of the use of jQuery and Javascript. It's a simple to-do list app that allows a user to add items, cross them out, and delete them. It is extremely small and lightweight, and could be re-used within another application or adjusted to suit other list needs.

## My Role
I created this application very quickly, within less than a day. It only requires scripts, a main file (`index.html`) and styling, which you can see in the file structure. The scripts and styling are kept separate for sanitary purposes then imported into the `index.html` file. The main goal here was to aid my understanding of how jQuery works in conjunction with Javascript. It's also just a handy tool.

# Dependencies:
None

# To Run Locally
To run this application, all you need to do is run the index.html file in your browser of choice (Chrome or Firefox are best).
First:
- Fork the repo
- Clone the repo
- Make any edits or play with the code
- Open the index.html file to see your work

I also hosted the app using gh-pages, especially since it's such a small application. But because of this it can be accessed anywhere, which is ideal for me. Here's a link to the hosted app: [ToDo-List](https://eryncraig.github.io/todo-list/).

## Conclusion
This small app was primarily an exercise in jQuery. If you feel there are more features that might be added or features that would increase my comprehension of jQuery capabilities, please message me on my website [here](https://eryncraig.github.io/official-portfolio/). Otherwise, contact me with any questions, and cheers to development!
